# NodeTest
Currently I've implemented a node system with A star.
the nodes are an interfaec and allow you to add as many fields as you want in case you have a complicated system.
the edges are the way I implemented neigboring nodes, and are easily extendable to allow for disabling connections in the future.
currently, I have no way in my mind of how to allow for turning on edges for a cost, in order to make them viable connections as well in cases where the difficulty of allowing the connection will be easy (opening a gripper for example).
